# ðŸš« Retired: Tappy! 

Per [our unmaintained repository status documentation](https://github.com/filamentgroup/standards-and-conventions/blob/master/repository-maintenance.md#unmaintained) this repository is now retired and is no longer accepting issue reports or pull requests. The touch delay in web browsers has [been solved natively](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/12/300ms-tap-delay-gone-away)! Hooray ðŸŽ‰!

Tappy is a minimal normalized tap event that works with touch, mouse, keyboard, and probably other inputs too.

## Why

Tappy allows you to bind to a `tap` event like you would any other user interaction, like `click`. The advantage of usting Tappy's  `tap` event over `click` is that it will allow you to execute code immediately on touch devices, eliminating the 300ms delay that click events have on platforms like iOS. Once bound to an element, Tappy's `tap` event will fire upon touch or other traditional interactions like mouse click, pressing the enter key, and more. 


## How-to

Tappy requires jQuery, or a similar framework of matching API conventions. 

To use, include `tappy.js` in your page, select an element and bind to a `tap` event. 

``` js
$( "a.my-link" ).bind( "tap", function( e ){ 
  alert( "tap!" );
}); 
```
In binding to the `tap` event, you'll be automatically preventing the browser's default click handling on the element, so be sure to handle that tap responsibly.

To use tappy to create fast-click navigation, you could do something like this on domready:

``` js
$( "a" ).each( function(){
  var href = $( this ).attr( "href" );
  if( href.indexOf( "#" ) !== 0 ){
				$( this ).bind( "tap", function(){
					window.location.href = this.href;
				});
			}
} );
```

### Unbinding

``` js
$( "a.my-link" ).unbind( "tap" ); 
```

## Notes:

This plugin makes several assumptions that may not work well for your project, but we've found them easy enough to work around.

Tappy works best when bound directly to a tappable element. In its current state, we don't recommend using it with event delegation due to the way it prevents default event behavior. That might change in a future update.

This plugin is built using a very limited portion of jQuery's API in attempt to be compatible with slimmer libraries that share jQuery's syntax. That's why it monkey-patches `bind` for example, rather than using the Special Events API. That said, we could make those changes, but this is working pretty well for our admittedly specific needs at the moment.

## What Not To Do

- Do not bind a child node to the tap event when a parent node is already bound. Ex:
``` html
<div class="foo">
    <div class="bar">
    </div>
</div>
```

``` js
$( ".foo" ).bind( "tap", function(){
    foo();
});

$( ".bar" ).bind( "tap", function(){
    bar();
});
```

If you do this, when the `.bar` element is tapped on, due to the nature of how the event is normalized, the callback function for bar will be called twice.


- Do not bind a tap event more than once to a single element. Ex:

```html
<button class="btn-classy">Don't Push Me</button>
```

```js
$( ".btn-classy" ).bind( "tap", function(){
    console.log( "I'm so classy" );
});

$( ".btn-classy" ).bind( "tap", function(){
    console.log( "Cuz I'm close to the... edge." );
});
```

If you do this, when the `<button>` is clicked, both callback functions will be called, twice.
